## ⚠️ **Important Note**  
All homework is done within the `homework` method. If any operations are required to compute the answer, they are implemented between the task's definition and the answer, all within the same `homework` method. This structure ensures clarity and organization throughout the tasks.

## 1️⃣ [First Task (1 part)](first.ipynb) and [First Task (2 part)](first2.ipynb)

### 📝 **Description**  
These two task files contain the execution of all tasks presented in the first link of the practice work. All the tasks I completed are displayed on the screen using the `homework` function.  

🔧 **Implementation Details**:  
- If a task required multiple lines of code, the implementation is included between the `homework` function calls that set up the task and display the answer.  
- These files introduce a custom Python function named `homework` to format and output multiple messages.  
- They also include imports for `numpy` and `os`, as well as examples of Python functions for data manipulation.

## 2️⃣ [Second Task](second.ipynb)

### 📝 **Description**  
This notebook demonstrates the use of Python's `numpy` library for various mathematical operations, such as:  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division  
- 📈 Exponentiation on arrays  

The `homework` function organizes and displays tasks with results printed to the output.  

📚 **Additional Details**:  
- A continuation or variation of the first notebook, it includes tasks related to subtraction and other computations.  
- The focus remains on demonstrating mathematical and array manipulations using `numpy`.

## 3️⃣ [Lecture Notes](lecture.ipynb)

### 📝 **Description**  
This file contains mostly code from the lectures. Here are the highlights:  
- 🖼️ **Working with the `Pillow` (PIL) library**:  
  - Converted the pixels of an image to color and edited the image programmatically.  
  - Applied effects like mirroring and custom transformations.  
  - Experimented with color inversions and grayscale conversions.  

🔧 **Implementation Details**:  
- Explored advanced manipulations of image arrays using Python.  
- Visualized changes in images with Matplotlib to validate transformations.

---

## 4️⃣ **Additional Highlights Across Files**

### 🔹 Array Creation and Manipulation:
- Practiced generating arrays using `numpy` methods like `arange` and `linspace`.
- Experimented with slicing, indexing, and dimensional analysis.

### 🔹 Practical Mathematical Applications:
- Performed arithmetic operations on multidimensional structures.  
- Analyzed the output of vector and matrix computations to enhance comprehension.

### 🔹 Image Processing with `Pillow`:
- Worked with images programmatically to apply filters, modify color channels, and mirror effects.

## 🛠️ **Conclusion**

In general, I’m very glad that we had this subject this semester, and I hope we’ll have something math- and code-related next semester! 🚀  

### 💡 **Reflections**:  
- I didn’t attend the classes, so I had to figure out `numpy` on my own (or rather, remember it).  
  - I actively used `numpy` about 4 years ago while developing math animations using the `manim` library.  
- Although I didn’t work with the `Pillow` library before, I used an analog to process images:  
  - I wrote an application to check topics from the **ZNO.osvita** website.  
  - It identified repeating tasks by:  
    - Automatically loading each page,  
    - Taking a screenshot,  
    - Comparing the screenshots, and  
    - Generating a folder with all the similar tasks. 📂
