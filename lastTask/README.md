## Практичне застосування чисельних даних

```console
All homework is done in the homework method. If some operations are required to output the answer, they are located between the task in the homework method and the answer in the same method
```

### 1. [First task first notebook](first.ipynb) and [First task second notebook](first2.ipynb)
#### Description: 
These two task files contain the execution of all the tasks presented in the the first link in the practice work. All the tasks that I have completed are displayed on the screen using the `homework` function.
If a task required multiple lines of code, the implementation is contained between the `homework` function requests for setting the task and displaying the answer.
These files introduces a custom Python function named homework that formats and outputs multiple messages. It also includes imports for numpy and os, as well as examples of Python functions for data manipulation.

### 2. [Second task](second.ipynb)
This notebook demonstrates the use of Python's `numpy` library for various mathematical operations, such as subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation on arrays. The `homework` function is used to organize and display tasks, with the results printed to the output.
A continuation or variation of the first notebook, this file includes code for a homework function, mathematical operations, and demonstrations of array manipulations with numpy. It appears to explore tasks related to subtraction and other computations.

### 3. [Lecture notes](lecture.ipynb)

This file contains mostly code from the lectures. Here are all the tasks I found in the lecture file.  The most interesting thing was to work with the PIL library, which converts the pixels of a given image to color and allows you to edit the image as you like programmatically. I took a photo of a banana and followed the instructions provided in the file, and also wrote my own modification that mirrored the image

## Conclution

In general, I am very glad that we had this subject this semester, and I hope that we will have something relatd to math and code next semester :)
Unfortunately, I didn't attend the classes, so I had to figure out numpy on my own (or rather remember it, because I used to use it actively about 4 years ago when I was developing math animations with the manin library). 
I didn't work with the pillow library, but I definitely used some kind of analog to process images (I wrote an application that checked all the topics from the ZNO.osvita website and found the tasks that were repeated, automatically loading each page, taking a screenshot, and then comparing the screenshots, generated a folder with all the similar tasks)
