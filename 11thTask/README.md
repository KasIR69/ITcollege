## Execution of the Work  

1. **Overview of the Library**  
   NumPy is a library for numerical computing that simplifies working with vectors, matrices, and multi-dimensional arrays. It provides efficient methods for numerical operations and is well-documented.  
   - Official Documentation: [NumPy: the absolute basics for beginners](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html).  

2. **Link to the Solution**  
   All code and solutions are available in the Jupyter Notebook:  
   [**main.ipynb**](main.ipynb).
