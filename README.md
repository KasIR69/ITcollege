# ITcollege üöÄ

This repository was created to publish laboratory works for the 4th year of **Numerical Methods** course taught by **Bohdan Buhyl**.  
The owner of the repository is **Ihor Kastranets**, a student of the **KN-41** group.

Ihor loves cycling üö¥, going on dates with girls üíë, organizing Rubik's Cube competitions üß©, learning Spanish and English üìö, playing the guitar üé∏, and binge-watching Netflix series üì∫.

To work with Visual Studio Code and GitHub: install Git, clone repository, write code, commit changes, push to GitHub, create branches, merge, resolve conflicts, and pull updates.

### 1. –ù–∞–ª–∞—à—Ç—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–æ–≤–∏—â–∞ üõ†Ô∏è
In this task, the following objectives were successfully completed:

- Git was installed on the system.
- Python 3.13 was installed.
- Visual Studio Code (Community edition) was set up.
- A new account was registered on GitHub.

The development environment is now fully configured for future work.

### 2. –°—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—è —Ä–µ–ø–æ–∑–∏—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—é üìÇ

In this task, the repository was created, the development environment was connected, and the first commit was successfully made. I have prior experience working with Markdown, formatting documentation and readme files in Markdown is familiar and straightforward. This background allows for efficient handling of the project‚Äôs documentation needs without the need for additional learning curves.

### 3. –û—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—è —Ä–æ–±—ñ—Ç —Ç–∞ –ø–µ—Ä—à–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–∞ üíª

- **Objective**: Successfully completed the task of creating a Python script and working with Jupyter Notebooks.
- **New Knowledge**: Learned how to set up the Python environment in VS Code, create Python scripts, and use Jupyter notebooks for interactive coding.
- **Challenges**: No major issues encountered during the task, and all the steps were executed smoothly.
- **Results**: The Python program successfully printed the current time and location. The same code was successfully executed in Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating the ability to work with both Python scripts and notebooks.

### 4. –û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∏ Python üêç

In this task, the following objectives were successfully completed:

- The use of context managers (`with` statement) for file operations was demonstrated.
- The current timestamp was written to a file in write mode.
- The file content was read and printed using read mode.
- Proper resource management was ensured by automatically closing the file after operations.

The principles of safe and efficient file handling were successfully applied, preparing the foundation for more advanced file operations in future tasks.

### 5. –û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∏ –û–û–ü

In this task, the following objectives were successfully completed:

- A class was created to handle various types of methods and properties.
- The program was designed to handle `None` input values and create a default "Anonymous" name when necessary.
- The `say_hello()` method was modified to include a customizable greeting message.
- A method was added to count the number of characters in the name.
- The total number of names in the list was compared with the number of objects created, explaining the effect of `None`.

### 11. –ß–∏—Å–ª–æ–≤—ñ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∏ –≤ Python

In this task, the following objectives were successfully completed:

- Explored the NumPy library for creating and manipulating arrays, including multidimensional structures.  
- Practiced generating arrays using methods like `arange` and `linspace`, identifying the underlying formulas.  
- Performed various operations on vectors and matrices, including slicing, indexing, and arithmetic manipulations.  
- Analyzed the dimensionality of arrays and explained the output of specific operations.  
- Addressed tasks involving practical application of NumPy methods and concepts, enhancing understanding of array structures.  
- Documented all results and explanations clearly in a Jupyter Notebook.
