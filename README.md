# ITcollege üöÄ

This repository was created to publish laboratory works for the 4th year of **Numerical Methods** course taught by **Bohdan Buhyl**.  
The owner of the repository is **Ihor Kastranets**, a student of the **KN-41** group.

Ihor loves cycling üö¥, going on dates with girls üíë, organizing Rubik's Cube competitions üß©, learning Spanish and English üìö, playing the guitar üé∏, and binge-watching Netflix series üì∫.

To work with Visual Studio Code and GitHub: install Git, clone repository, write code, commit changes, push to GitHub, create branches, merge, resolve conflicts, and pull updates.

### 1. –ù–∞–ª–∞—à—Ç—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–æ–≤–∏—â–∞ üõ†Ô∏è
In this task, the following objectives were successfully completed:

- Git was installed on the system.
- Python 3.13 was installed.
- Visual Studio Code (Community edition) was set up.
- A new account was registered on GitHub.

The development environment is now fully configured for future work.

### 2. –°—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—è —Ä–µ–ø–æ–∑–∏—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—é üìÇ

In this task, the repository was created, the development environment was connected, and the first commit was successfully made. I have prior experience working with Markdown, formatting documentation and readme files in Markdown is familiar and straightforward. This background allows for efficient handling of the project‚Äôs documentation needs without the need for additional learning curves.
